## Planning, Game Design

### Synopsis
Player assumes the role of a whaling vessel captain. They are tasked with making their fortune on the seas by hunting sperm whales for their treasured spermacetti. They must shrewdly pick their crew members and decide upon provisions, which manifest themselves as traditional roguelike RPG elements, but also assume more complex form, and then plot a course. While upon the seas, besides dealing with the daily upkeep such as food supplies and wind and sea conditions, the player must also deal with favourable or unfavourable circumstances that arise such as coming across herds of whales, holding gam with other whaling vessels or coming into conflict with hostile vessels (the relevence is naval combat and "pirates" to the whaling narrative is limited), storms and crew sentiments. 


### Movement & General Gameplay

Let us assume that the reader is versed with basics of the roguelike game. Loomings differs from the traditional rogue-like in the economy of movement. Every tile or tiles traversed represents diminishing food stores, ship wear and changing crew morale. The player must shrewdly pick a course and stick with it lest they earn the ill-favour of their crew. They must cautiously attune to the methods of nautical navigation -- such as examining the position of the sun or inspecting their compass, sexton, etc.
